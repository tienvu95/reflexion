Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?
Context (truncated 1000 chars): Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.

The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos a...

Answer a PubMedQA biomedical question by having a Thought, then Finish with your answer. First decide the label (yes, no, or maybe) and then provide a short justification prefixed with "Reason:". Thought can reason about the PubMed abstract context and the question. Finish[answer] returns the answer and finishes the task. Always rely on the provided context and restrict the final answer to yes, no, or maybe.
Here are some examples:
Relevant PubMed Context: The chronic rhinosinusitis study profiled 35 surgical patients and controls. Group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) frequencies were higher in eosinophilic CRS, correlated with nasal polyps (P = 0.002), tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004), blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005), and asthma, and tracked with worse nasal symptom scores.
Question: Are ILC2s increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps/eosinophilia?
Thought: The trial explicitly links higher ILC2 levels to nasal polyps and eosinophilic disease, so yes.
Action: Finish[yes]

Relevant PubMed Context: In a retrospective cohort of 304 STEMI patients treated with fibrinolysis, admission glucose was higher in failed reperfusion (126 vs 110 mg/dL, p<0.001). Hyperglycemia independently predicted failed fibrinolysis (HR 4.79), alongside longer delay to treatment and anterior MI.
Question: Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion after fibrinolysis?
Thought: Because hyperglycemia remained an independent predictor, the answer is yes.
Action: Finish[yes]

Relevant PubMed Context: A review of 41 emergency medicine intervention systematic reviews (2013) found only 8 searched clinical trial registries, though half of those searches identified unpublished studies.
Question: Do emergency medicine systematic reviews routinely search trial registries?
Thought: Since only 20% included registry searches, the answer is no.
Action: Finish[no]

A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.

Question: Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia?
Context (truncated 1000 chars): Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.

100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.

In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.

Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE.
